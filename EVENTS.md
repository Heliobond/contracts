# Heliobond Events Catalog

This document provides a catalog of all events emitted by the Heliobond smart contracts for off-chain indexers and developers.

Each event lists the public [`INTERFACE.md`](INTERFACE.md) function(s) that emit it, so indexer authors can trace an event back to the call that produced it.
